# Intelligent Search Algorithms Projects

This repository contains two projects that demonstrate the use of intelligent search algorithms implemented in Java.

## Project 1: Parcel Delivery System

### Overview

The Parcel Delivery System is designed to optimize the delivery of parcels for a delivery company. It utilizes intelligent search algorithms, specifically A* and UCS (Uniform Cost Search), to find the shortest, most efficient, and cost-effective routes for delivering all parcels.

### Features

- Intelligent Routing: The system intelligently calculates optimal routes for delivering parcels, taking into account factors like distance, traffic, and parcel priorities.
- A* and UCS Algorithms: The project demonstrates the implementation of A* and UCS algorithms for pathfinding.
- Java Implementation: The entire project is built using the Java programming language.

### Usage

1. Compile the Java source code.
2. Run the compiled program to optimize the delivery routes for parcels.

## Project 2: Blob Wars Game

### Overview

Blob Wars is a two-player game implemented in Java. Players can compete against each other or against an AI opponent with different difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard). The AI opponent's behavior is driven by intelligent search algorithms, specifically Min-Max and Alpha-Beta Pruning.

### Features

- Two-Player Game: Play Blob Wars against a human opponent or an AI opponent.
- AI Opponent: The AI opponent uses Min-Max and Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithms to make intelligent decisions.
- Multiple Difficulty Levels: Challenge yourself with AI opponents of varying difficulty levels.
- Java Implementation: The game is entirely written in Java.

### Usage

1. Compile the Java source code.
2. Start the Blob Wars game and select the game mode (Player vs. Player or Player vs. AI).
3. Choose the AI opponent's difficulty level (easy, medium, or hard).
